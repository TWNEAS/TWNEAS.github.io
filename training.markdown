## 12 LEAD ELECTROCARDIOGRAM

A 12 lead electrocardiogram, otherwise to refered to as a 12 lead or an ECG, is a way of tracing the heart's electrical impulses.

### HOW DO YOU DO IT?

-I'd take a sheet of electrodes-

-I’d place V1 on the 4th intercostal space at the right sternal edge-

-I’d place V2 on the 4th intercostal space at the left sternal edge-

-I’d place V3 midway between the V2 and V4 electrodes-

-I’d place V4 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line-

-I’d place V5 on the left anterior axillary line at the same horizontal level as V4-

-I’d place V6 on the left mid-axillary line at the same horizontal level as V4 and V5-

-I’d place RA on the ulnar styloid process of the right arm-

-I’d place LA on the ulnar styloid process of the left arm-

-I’d place LL on the medial malleolus of the left leg-

-I’d place RL on the medial malleolus of the right leg-

## BLOOD GLUCOSE
-I'd take a glucometer-

-I'd prick the index finger-

-I'd press analyse-

[Glucose levels for a non-diabetic is 4.0 to 5.9mmol/L]

Type two diabetes are 4 to 7mmol/L.

Type one diabetes are 5 to 7mmol/L.

Children with type one is 4 to 7mmol/L.

## BLOOD PRESSURE
-I'd roll up sleve-

-I'd slide BP cuff up arm-

-I'd inflate-

[Normal BP is 90/60 to 120/80]
Below 90/60 is hypotension.
Above 140/90 is hypertension.

## HEART RATE

### Pulse Oximeter Method

-I'd take a pulse oximeter-

-I'd place on index finger-

[Normal Pulse is 60-100 for an adult, see child HR in the diagram blow.]

Below 60 is bradycardia.

Above 100 is tachycardia.

## Manual Method
-I'd take two fingers-

-I'd feel for the carotid [neck] / pedal [foot] / radial [wrist] / posterior tibial [ankle] / femoral [groin] pulse-

-I'd count the amount of beats felt per minuite-

## I-GEL

### WHAT IS IT?

I-Gel is like an OPA and has a wide section at the bottom and it is there to ensure that things go down the trachea and do not go up the oesophagus. Major facial trauma, compromised airway, cardiac arrest with low SPO2 and must be unconscious.

### HOW IS IT DONE?

-I’d take I-GEL-

-I'd lxxubxxxicaxxte-

-I’d place into mouth-

-I’d advance-

-I'd select a proper size iGel-

-I'd perform the head tilt/chin lift-

-I'd apply some lubricant to the back side of the iGel-

-I'd insert the iGel into the patient's airway until resistance is felt-

-I'd connect the BVM to the iGel and start ventilating-

-I'd take stethoscope-

-I'd listen to lungs-

(Is it placed correctly?)

-I'd take thomas tube holder-

-I'd secure the iGel-

## INTRAOSSEOUS CANULATION

### WHAT IS IT?

It is a way of delivering drugs into a patients bloodstream, and it is done by pushing the drugs through the bone marrow.

### HOW IS IT DONE?

-I'd take ez-io drill-

-I'd prep needle set and driver-

-I'd attach an appropriate size drill head-

-I'd position the EZ IO parallel to the bone and insert introducer until resistance is felt-

-I'd pull the trigger and advance the drill piece until I hear a pop-

-I'd secure the needle and remove the EZ-IO gun-

-I'd flush with 10ml saline-

-I'd secure in place-

## INTRAVENOUS CANNULATION

### WHAT IS IT?

It is a way of delivering drugs into a patients bloodstream, and it is done through the use of a vein.

## HOW IS IT DONE?

-I'd roll up sleeve-

-I'd tie tourniquet-

-I'd wipe area-

-I'd palpate for a vein-

(Would I find one?)

-I'd insert introducer and cannula at 20 degrees-

-I'd observe flashback-

-I'd advance cannula 2mm-

-I’d fix the introducer needle-

-I’d fully advance the cannula-

-I’d remove the introducer needle-

-I'd secure with an sterile dressing-

-I'd flush with 5ml saline-
